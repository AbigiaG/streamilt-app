# Financial Inclusion in Africa - Machine Learning Project
This repository contains a Machine Learning project aimed at predicting which individuals in East Africa are most likely to have or use a bank account, based on demographic data. The dataset was provided as part of the Financial Inclusion in Africa challenge hosted by the Zindi platform.

# Project Overview
Financial inclusion refers to individuals and businesses having access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs—such as transactions, payments, savings, credit, and insurance—delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.

This project uses a machine learning model to analyze demographic information and predict the likelihood of individuals having or using a bank account. The model is deployed through a Streamlit web application, allowing users to interact with the model and make predictions.

# Key Features
Dataset: Contains demographic data and financial service usage for approximately 33,600 individuals across East Africa.
Goal: Build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of individuals having a bank account.
Deployment: Deployed using Streamlit, enabling users to make predictions based on demographic inputs.
Dataset
The dataset consists of various features representing demographic information of individuals in East Africa. The dataset includes features such as:

age_of_respondent: Age of the individual.
gender_of_respondent: Gender of the individual.
country: Country where the individual resides.
education_level: Education level of the individual.
job_type: Employment type of the individual.
Has a bank account: Target variable (whether the individual has a bank account or not).

# Follow the steps below to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.7+
Pip (Python package installer)
Git (for version control)
Streamlit (for deployment)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-inclusion-africa.git
cd financial-inclusion-africa
Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset: Make sure you have the dataset. You can use the dataset provided by Zindi or the one linked in this project.

# Run the Project: You can run the Jupyter notebook to train and test the model:

bash
jupyter notebook
Streamlit Deployment: After training the model, deploy the Streamlit app locally with the following command:

bash
streamlit run app.py
# Project Instructions
# Data Exploration:

Import the dataset and conduct basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Use pandas profiling reports to generate insights.
Handle missing and corrupted values.
Remove duplicates and handle outliers if they exist.
Feature Engineering:

Encode categorical variables.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing for machine learning.
Model Training:

Train and test a machine learning classifier (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) based on the insights from the exploratory data analysis.
Streamlit Application:

Create a Streamlit app with input fields for the features.
Allow users to enter feature values and validate the input.
Use the trained machine learning model to predict whether an individual is likely to have a bank account.
Deploy on Streamlit Share:

Set up a GitHub repository for the project.
Deploy the Streamlit app on Streamlit Cloud.
How to Deploy Your App on Streamlit Share
# Create a Streamlit Account: 
Streamlit link: https://old-pens-cut.loca.lt/ 

Create a new GitHub repository and push code:
bash
git init
git add .
